import Foundation
import Observation

/// Extension for `@Observable` classes
/// that want to expose streaming helpers for property changes.
/// It enables convenient methods for streaming property values as they change over time.
///
/// Conforming types gain two main methods:
/// - `stream(_:)`: Produces an `AsyncStream` that emits
/// 	the property's current value immediately,
/// 	and then yields a new value every time the property changes.
/// - `throwingStream(_:, finishOn:)`: Produces an `AsyncThrowingStream` that emits
/// 	property values as above, but can finish early with an error
/// 	when a given predicate signals to stop.
///
/// These helpers leverage Swift's Observation framework and are
/// intended to be called from the main actor. The streams automatically stop emitting
/// when no longer consumed, and are designed for integration with
/// Swift Concurrency's async/await patterns.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
/// class MyModel: Observable, ObservationStreaming {
///     @Observation var count: Int = 0
/// }
///
/// let model = MyModel()
/// let stream = model.stream(\.count)
/// for await value in stream {
///     // Handle count changes
/// }
/// ```

	/// Creates an `AsyncStream` that emits values from the specified key path
	/// on the conforming `@Observable` class.
	/// The stream yields the current value immediately and then emits a new value
	/// each time the observed property changes.
	///
	/// - Parameter keyPath: A key path to the property to observe and emit values for.
	/// - Returns: An `AsyncStream` that produces the property's value on each change
	/// 	(and immediately on start).
	///
	/// - Important: This method must be called from the main actor.
	/// 	The stream automatically stops emitting when no longer consumed.
	///
	/// - Example:
	/// ```swift
	/// let stream = object.stream(\.property)
	/// for await value in stream {
	///     // React to property changes here
	/// }
	/// ```

	/// The stream yields the current value immediately and then emits a new value

	/// when the provided predicate returns a non-nil error.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - keyPath: A key path to the property to observe and emit values for.
	///   - predicate: A closure that takes the current value and returns an `Error`
	///   		if the stream should finish throwing, or `nil` to continue streaming.
	/// - Returns: An `AsyncThrowingStream` that produces the property's value
	/// 		on each change (and immediately on start), and may finish early
	/// 		with an error.
	///
	/// - Important: This method must be called from the main actor.
	/// 		The stream automatically stops emitting when no longer consumed.
	///
	/// - Example:

	///         return MyCustomError.stop
